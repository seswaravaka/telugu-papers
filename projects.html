    <h1>
      XRAN Product Platforms<br/>
      & Management Systems<br/>
      <span class="muted">JMA Experience</span>
    </h1>

    <p>
      At JMA, I owned and delivered large‑scale XRAN product platforms
      and management systems over a ten‑year period. My work spanned
      backend systems, hosted portals, customer‑specific integrations,
      and long‑term product delivery across multiple releases.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Project Ownership</h2>

    <p>
      I owned and delivered three primary categories of projects,
      covering both core product platforms and customer‑facing systems.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Product backends and portals</strong>, including the
        XRAN platform, XOAS Portal, and Supervisor Portals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hosted applications and portals</strong>, such as the
        RA Portal, XRAN Licensing Portal, SDRU Credits Portal, and
        integrations with SAP and Flexera.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customer‑specific applications and portals</strong>,
        delivering custom XRAN portals and integrations tailored to
        individual customer environments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr/>

    <h2>XRAN Management Platform</h2>

    <p>
      I designed and developed a centralized management platform for
      XRAN products, providing unified control and visibility across
      the entire product lifecycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform supports configuration management, performance
      monitoring, fault and alarm handling, log management, system
      monitoring, and software installation and upgrades.
    </p>

    <p>
      Architecturally, the system is built using PostgreSQL and
      Spring Boot–based microservices, with REST APIs, Kafka events,
      and streaming connections enabling scalable data ingestion
      and communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      All services are containerized and deployed on Kubernetes‑based
      clusters, including k3s and OpenShift.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Architecture & Implementation</h2>

    <p>
      I designed service boundaries, inter‑service communication
      patterns, and data exchange contracts. Services were packaged
      as Docker images and deployed as microservices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kafka was used extensively for inter‑service communication,
      enabling a near event‑driven architecture across the platform.
      REST APIs and streaming connections supported both synchronous
      and real‑time data flows.
    </p>

    <p>
      APIs were published using OpenAPI 3.0 / Swagger, and SDKs were
      developed and shared with customers to support external
      integrations with the centralized management system.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Security & Access Management</h2>

    <p>
      Security was a core design principle. I implemented OAuth2 and
      OpenID Connect authentication across all user‑facing services.
      Istio was used as the service mesh gateway, with oauth2‑proxy
      providing authentication and authorization enforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform integrated with Keycloak, customized for product‑
      specific requirements, and supported customer directory
      integrations including LDAP, Active Directory, and external
      identity providers.
    </p>

    <p>
      SAML integration was implemented for customer environments such
      as Verizon, along with mutual TLS authentication using
      certificates.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>APIs & Integrations</h2>

    <p>
      I collaborated closely with customers and system integrators,
      including Cisco, SoftBank, and Wind Tre, to support integrations
      with external systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to REST APIs, SOAP APIs and SDKs were developed using
      JAX‑WS. These interfaces were later deprecated in favor of
      modern REST‑based integrations.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Operations, Monitoring & Automation</h2>

    <p>
      I designed and implemented automated configuration management
      with backup and continuous validation, ensuring that correct
      configurations were consistently applied across all managed
      elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prometheus was used to collect performance metrics from all
      nodes, with Grafana providing visualization and dashboards.
      Centralized logging, fault handling, and alarm management were
      built into the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      NGINX was integrated for front‑end traffic handling and
      request routing.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Configuration Management & Orchestration</h2>

    <p>
      The platform integrated with SaltStack using CherryPy REST APIs
      to support configuration and orchestration workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ansible jobs were used to invoke automation playbooks, which in
      turn triggered Helm chart deployments on targeted Kubernetes
      clusters.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>UI & Real‑Time Communication</h2>

    <p>
      User interfaces were developed using Angular. Real‑time updates
      were delivered to the UI using WebSockets and Server‑Sent Events
      (SSE).
    </p>

    <p>
      Kafka listeners, Kafka Streams, and producers were implemented
      to support real‑time event processing and data propagation.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Release Management & Delivery</h2>

    <p>
      XRAN product development followed a release‑based model, with
      each release treated as an individual project and owned end‑to‑
      end by the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over a ten‑year period, I managed the design and delivery of more
      than 30 major and minor releases, coordinating architecture,
      development, and delivery across teams.
